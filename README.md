## Sahat's tutorial: Create a character voting app for Eve Online

This is my playground to use React, Flux, es6, node.js, socket.io, mongodb, and others awesome javascript libraries.

You can find the base tutorial for this application [here](http://sahatyalkabov.com/create-a-character-voting-app-using-react-nodejs-mongodb-and-socketio/),
It's a very long tutorial, but totally worth it.

I'll add unit tests to start practice javascript testing libraries and will add new features to this project, trying to don't mess with the original idea.


## Getting Started

### Installation

After you cloned the repo:

```
$ npm install
```

This command will install external dependencies.

### Running

Run this command to build the App.

```
$ gulp
```

This command will prepare the app to run.
In another terminal, run this.

The server will be online, and you can acess `http://localhost:3000`.
